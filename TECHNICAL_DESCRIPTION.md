## 2. Technical Field

The invention relates to the field of digital identity and physical location verification. Specifically, it pertains to systems that use blockchain technology, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and artificial intelligence to create a secure, immutable, and verifiable link between a physical address and a digital identity.

## 3. Background of the Invention

Traditional addressing systems are often fragmented, inconsistent, and prone to inaccuracies, particularly in developing regions or informal settlements. This creates significant challenges for logistics, emergency services, e-commerce, and financial services that rely on accurate location data for "Know Your Customer" (KYC) compliance. There is a need for a decentralized, tamper-proof system that can provide a single source of truth for physical addresses, controlled by the property owner but verifiable by authorized third parties.

The present invention aims to solve these problems by creating a digital twin of a physical address on a blockchain, represented as a unique NFT. This provides a platform for secure and transparent management, verification, and utilization of address data.

## 4. Detailed Description of the Invention

The system comprises several key processes and components:

### a. User and Address Registration

1.  **Data Input:** A user initiates the process by providing their personal or company details, the full physical address, and the precise GPS coordinates of the property.
2.  **Wallet Generation:** Based on the GPS coordinates and country code, the system generates a unique cryptographic wallet address (e.g., an Ethereum address). This "country-stamped" address serves as the foundational identifier for the property on the blockchain.
3.  **Photo Submission & Signing:** The user provides a clear photograph of the property's main entrance. The system then digitally "signs" this photograph by embedding metadata onto it, including the generated crypto address, the physical address text, and a timestamp. This creates an auditable link between the photo, the location, and the time of capture.
4.  **Submission:** The user submits this signed photo and accompanying data to the platform. The address is created in the system with a "Pending" status.

### b. AI-Powered and Distributed Validation

The core of the invention's security lies in its multi-layered validation process:

1.  **AI Cross-Validation (Initial Check):** An AI flow (`validateDoorPhoto`) performs an initial check. It compares the user-submitted door photo with satellite imagery corresponding to the provided GPS coordinates. It analyzes architectural features, building type, and environmental context to determine if the ground-level photo plausibly belongs to the building shown in the satellite view. It also verifies that the embedded crypto address and physical address in the photo's signature match the submitted data.
2.  **Distributed Human Validation:** To prevent fraud, the system can dispatch a validation request to a network of trusted, third-party validators.
    *   A validator is given the GPS coordinates and the original user's photo.
    *   The validator must physically travel to the location.
    *   Using a secure interface, the validator captures a new photo of the same entrance. Their device also captures their current GPS coordinates.
    *   An AI flow (`compareValidationPhotos`) then performs a forensic comparison between the original user's photo and the validator's new photo. It scrutinizes details like door material, hardware, doorframe, and immediate surroundings to confirm they are the same location.
3.  **Status Update:** Upon successful validation from one or more parties, the address's status is updated from "Pending" to "Verified" on the platform and potentially on the blockchain via a smart contract transaction.

### c. NFT Minting and Management

1.  **Minting:** Once "Verified," the digital address is minted as an ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token (NFT) on a public blockchain. The NFT's metadata points to the verified data, including the signed photo, GPS coordinates, and validation history, often stored on a decentralized file system like IPFS.
2.  **Ownership:** The NFT is transferred to the user's personal crypto wallet, granting them cryptographic ownership and control over their digital address.
3.  **Management:** The user can manage their address via a dashboard. They can grant limited-use "sub-addresses" to tenants or family members, view an immutable history of all activity related to the address, and control which third-party services can access it.

### d. Incident Response and Succession

1.  **Incident Reporting:** If a property is destroyed or access is lost (e.g., natural disaster, user memory loss), the owner or a designated successor can report an incident. This marks the address NFT as "Compromised."
2.  **Recovery Process:** An administrator initiates a secure recovery wizard. This involves verifying the identity of the user or their designated successor through multi-factor checks (e.g., government ID, biometric data, linked phone numbers).
3.  **Succession:** Upon successful verification, the system facilitates the transfer of the address NFT to a designated successor's wallet, ensuring the continuity of the digital asset as per the owner's wishes.

## 6. Abstract

A system and method for creating and verifying a digital representation of a physical address using blockchain technology. The system involves a user submitting a physical address, GPS coordinates, and a photograph of the location's entrance. The system generates a unique cryptographic identifier and digitally signs the photograph with this identifier and other metadata. Validation is performed through a combination of an AI model, which compares the submitted photo with satellite imagery, and a distributed network of human validators. Upon successful validation, a non-fungible token (NFT) representing the physical address is minted on a blockchain and transferred to the user, providing a secure, tamper-proof, and verifiable digital asset corresponding to the real-world location. The system includes protocols for managing address access, succession, and incident response.
